    <h1 class="title">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
    <h2 class="title2">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS separates the content of a webpage from its design and layout, allowing web developers to control the appearance of multiple pages simultaneously by defining styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. It simplifies the process of website maintenance and enhances flexibility and control over the visual aspects of web pages.</h2>
